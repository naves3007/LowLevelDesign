~A Fool Can Write Code that a computer can Understand~

## Always Start with Mastering OOPS
    Abstraction (block), Encapsulation (hide), Inheritance (template copy), Polymorphism (clones)

Abstract Class (Virtual Functions)
Abstract Class (Virtual Functions) | Interface in Java
Virtual Functions (Implemented in Inheritance)
Access Modifiers
Pointers to Base Class -> Obj of Derived Class

Overloading
Overriding


/*
    SOLID Principles in C++ -> Correct Way of Writing Code
*/
    Single Responsiblity
    (Single Class Single Job, if you find a reason to change it change it!)
    
    Open Close
    (Open for Inheritance, Closed for Too Much Modifications, Pass it in params)
    (Think of it, when you find an IF/Else, pass new conditions are new derived class)

    Liskov Subtitution
    (Base Class should have common methods which will be used in relevant derived Class)

    Interface Segregation
    (LSP & ISP Similar: ISP Says "base class should be small")

    Dependency Inversion
    (Depends on a common Interface)

    
/*
    Framework 1 -> Correcting Code
    S
        Fn having too many Responsiblity
    O
        Huge set of (IF / ELSE)
    L 
        Forced Overrides
    I 
        Bulky base Class
    D
        Static Creations  
*/

Interface -> Class / Struct Not Implemented, which will be Implemented in Derived / child class in future.
